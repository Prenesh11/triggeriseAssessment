Hi and welcome

1. You can import the project into intellij via pom, resolve maven dependencies, then hit build and run. I have used JDK8.
2. I have added a postman collection with the 4 examples from the test for testing purposes "Triggerise_Assessment.postman_collection". You can just import this into postman and execute the services
3. the project will run on localhost:8080
4. Please contact me should you require any additional assistance.
